üöÄ **World Layoffs Data Project** üåç

The global employment landscape has experienced significant shifts in recent years, as highlighted by our comprehensive World Layoffs Dashboard.

 The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of layoffs by country, company, stage, and industry, allowing us to better understand the factors driving these trends.

**Tools used for this Analysis**:

1. **MySQL for Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I used MySQL to clean the raw data and perform in-depth exploratory data analysis. This helped me uncover key patterns and insights from the dataset.

2. **Power BI to Create a Comprehensive Dashboard:** Leveraging the insights gained from MySQL, I then used Power BI to design and develop the World Layoffs Dashboard, which provides a detailed view of layoffs across various dimensions.

3. **Layoff Analysis Visualizations Using MySQL and Power BI:**

The visualizations in this layoff analysis are based on MySQL queries and imported into Power BI for detailed analysis. 

The map visualization specifically uses data from the layoffs_staging2 table, while the other visualizations are derived from the EDA analysis. 

This approach provides a comprehensive view of layoffs across companies, countries, industries, and time periods, offering powerful insights through clear and impactful visual representations.
